## Problem sheet

### Problem #1
Create a program that takes you and a partner's name and age and then outputs the two names and the difference in age

Example output (>>> represents output, everything else is user input):
``` console
>>> Welcome to the age difference calculator
>>> What is your name?
Jake
>>> What is your age?
12
>>> What is your partner’s name?
Molly
>>> What is their age?
14
>>> Jake, you and Molly’s age is 2 year apart.
```

### Problem #2
Now, instead of outputting the difference in age, can you write a program to output the average age between the two of you?

### Problem #3
Create a program that will take two numbers as input and output the addition/subtraction/multiplication/division (you decide) of the two numbers.

### Problem #4
Knowing that the area of a triable is (.5)*(base)*(height), create a program that takes as input the base and height of a triangle and outputs its area

### Probelem #5
Knowing that the area of a circle is (3.14)*(radius)*(radius), create a program that takes as input the radius of a circle and outputs its area
