To run the program cloan the repository and navigate it using a unix terminal. Then you must start a python local server to host the website on. Running the files locally may result in firebase errors.

Type the following to start a python 3.X server
```
python -m http.server
```
For a python 2.X server type
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
If this gives you error try typing
```
pip3 install html
```
and try restarting the server. Note, just type 'pip' if you have python 2.X. If this still does not work you may not have pip installed. If so, google how to install it because I do not remember. If you found this confusing follow https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server to start a python local server
